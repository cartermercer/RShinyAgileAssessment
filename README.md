# RShinyAgileAssessment
This project was one that I completed during a senior capstone project. It shows how a web app written in R Shiny can act as a way to collect data, write data to the cloud, load data from the cloud, and output data onto a dashboard. Check out the published app here: https://carter-mercer.shinyapps.io/AgileAssessmentShinyExample/ .
